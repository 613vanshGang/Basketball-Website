        The National Basketball Association (NBA), professional basketball league formed in
        the United States in 1949 by the merger of two rival organizations,
        the National Basketball League (founded 1937) and the Basketball Association of America (founded 1946).
        In 1976 the NBA absorbed four teams from the American Basketball Association (ABA), which disbanded that year. </p> </center>


  <center><h2>League growth and membership</h2></center>


<center><p>By the early 1980s the NBA was plagued by money-losing franchises, low attendance, declining television ratings,<br>
  and limited national appeal. The league soon rebounded under the leadership of David Stern, NBA commissioner from 1984,<br>
  who helped transform it into an international entertainment company.<br>
  Aggressive marketing highlighted star players such as Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and, especially, Michael Jordan. <br>
  Other innovations included league limits on player salaries, lucrative broadcast rights for network and cable television,<br>
  and expanded All-Star Game festivities. </p> </center>

  <center><h2>Late 90s and the 2000s</h2></center>

  <center><p id="2000"> After the retirement of NBA legend, Michael Jordan, the new era of basketball commenced. NBA basketball in the 2000s has its share of detractors because of the style of play, <br>
 but it deserves appreciation because there was still greatness every single night. The studs who played within the era speak for themselves, <br>
 from Kobe Bryant to Kevin Garnett to Tim Duncan to LeBron James to a host of others who helped pave the way for the stars of today. <p><center>
